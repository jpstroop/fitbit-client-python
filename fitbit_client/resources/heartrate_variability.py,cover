>     """Provides access to Fitbit Heart Rate Variability (HRV) API for retrieving daily metrics.
  
>     This resource handles endpoints for retrieving HRV measurements taken during sleep, which
>     is a key indicator of recovery, stress, and overall autonomic nervous system health.
  
>     API Reference: https://dev.fitbit.com/build/reference/web-api/heartrate-variability/
  
>     Required Scopes:
>       - heartrate: Required for all endpoints in this resource
  
>     Note:
>         Heart Rate Variability (HRV) measures the variation in time between consecutive
>         heartbeats. High HRV generally indicates better cardiovascular fitness, stress
>         resilience, and recovery capacity. Low HRV may indicate stress, fatigue, or illness.
  
>         HRV is calculated using the RMSSD (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences)
>         measurement in milliseconds. Typical healthy adult values range from 20-100ms,
>         with higher values generally indicating better autonomic function.
  
>         HRV data collection requirements:
>         - Enabled Health Metrics tile in mobile app dashboard
>         - Minimum 3 hours of sleep
>         - Creation of sleep stages log during main sleep period
>         - Device compatibility (check Fitbit Product page for supported devices)
>         - No Premium subscription required
  
>         Data processing occurs after device sync and takes ~15 minutes to become available.
>         HRV measurements span sleep periods that may begin on the previous day.
